        Lied [1]: Titel: "In Christ Alone", Liedtext: In Christ alone will I glory | Though I could pride myself in battles won | For I've been blessed beyond measure | And by His strength alone I overcome | Oh I could stop and count successes | Like diamonds in my hand | But those trophies could not equal | To the grace by which I stand In Christ alone I place my trust | And find my glory in the power of the cross | In ev'ry victory let it be said of me | My source of strength my source of hope | Is Christ alone In Christ alone will I glory | For only by His grace I am redeemed | Only His tender mercy | Could reach beyond my weakness to my need | Now I seek no greater honor | Than just to know Him more | And to count my gains but losses | To the glory of my Lord My source of strength my source of hope | Is Christ alone


        Lied [2]: Titel: "Man Of Sorrows", Liedtext: Man of sorrows Lamb of God | By His own betrayed | The sin of man and wrath of God | Has been on Jesus laid Silent as He stood accused | Beaten mocked and scorned | Bowing to the Father's will | He took a crown of thorns Oh that rugged cross my salvation | Where Your love poured out over me | Now my soul cries out hallelujah | Praise and honour unto Thee Sent of heaven God's own Son | To purchase and redeem | And reconcile the very ones | Who nailed Him to that tree Now my debt is paid | It is paid in full | By the precious blood | That my Jesus spilled | Now the curse of sin | Has no hold on me | Whom the Son sets free | Oh is free indeed See the stone is rolled away | Behold the empty tomb | Hallelujah God be praised | He's risen from the grave
